                                    If you're Dominican and were alive during the 1980s and '90s, chances are Juan Luis Guerra's hits became the soundtrack of your life. They'd play at every family function, during long car rides, or at the beach, and he was likely your mami's favorite artist to blast during her Saturday morning cleaning rituals. Throughout his prolific and four-decade career, Guerra has not only reinvented the tropical rhythms of his native Dominican Republic alongside his band 4.40, but he's also reached audiences way beyond just the Dominican community. With 30 million-plus albums sold around the world and more than 20 Latin Grammy wins, Guerra has become a legend in the Latin music space and not just for his poetic lyrics - he's often referred to as the Pablo Neruda of merengue and bachata - but also for never being afraid to innovate or color outside of the lines of what "Dominican music" is supposed to sound like.
